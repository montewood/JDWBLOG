# Dataset Description

&nbsp;The dataset contains four directories: monet_tfrec, photo_tfrec, monet_jpg, and photo_jpg. The monet_tfrec and monet_jpg directories contain the same painting images, and the photo_tfrec and photo_jpg directories contain the same photos.

&nbsp;We recommend using TFRecords as a Getting Started competition is a great way to become more familiar with a new data format, but JPEG images have also been provided.

&nbsp;The monet directories contain Monet paintings. Use these images to train your model.

&nbsp;The photo directories contain photos. Add Monet-style to these images and submit your generated jpeg images as a zip file. Other photos outside of this dataset can be transformed but keep your submission file limited to 10,000 images.

&nbsp;Note: Monet-style art can be created from scratch using other GAN architectures like DCGAN. The submitted image files do not necessarily have to be transformed photos.

&nbsp;Check out the CycleGAN dataset to experiment with the artistic style of other artists.

## Files
 - monet_jpg - 300 Monet paintings sized 256x256 in JPEG format
 - monet_tfrec - 300 Monet paintings sized 256x256 in TFRecord format
 - photo_jpg - 7028 photos sized 256x256 in JPEG format
 - photo_tfrec - 7028 photos sized 256x256 in TFRecord format
 
## Submission format
 - Your kernel's output must be called images.zip and contain 7,000-10,000 images sized 256x256.
